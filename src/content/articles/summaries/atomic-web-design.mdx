## principles

**atomic web design** is all about **modularity**. we might expect to find the same positive outcomes to modularization in web design, but web technologies have specific intricacies : managing semantic and layout elements (html), handling styling elements (css) and sparkles of interactivity that also go with its own set of files and logic (javascript).

the idea behind **atomic web design** is to provide consistency, cohesion and
reusable elements that are easier to maintain over time and that can scale
easily. on the practical side, this also impels to think about the way we want
to build a web application.

let's list the principles :

- encourages the use of shared vocabulary, makes it easier to communicate about
  the code base
- results in a coherent style framework
- makes web elements reusable and, thus, scalable and maintainable
- makes testing easier by providing smaller interfaces that are testable in isolation
- forces to think about an implementation before actually building it

## workflow

in a perfect world, you would like to follow those steps :

- design with a tool like figma : build templates and refactor web elements into reusable components
- build a composition diagram, isolating and describing each component, defining and typing their inputs and outputs
- define a project layout that must be enforced when actually developing, convert that using tools like storybook
- when not following the initial web design template, try to think ahead and refactor components as soon as needed

## going extreme

## the stack

- figma
- storybook
- component javascript library
- tailwindcss
